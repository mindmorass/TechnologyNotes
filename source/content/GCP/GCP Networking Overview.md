# GCP Networking Overview

## Overview

- **GCP Networking** → Comprehensive suite of networking services for connecting, securing, and managing cloud resources
- **Key Features** → Global VPC networks, multiple connectivity options, integrated security, and hybrid cloud support
- **Use Cases** → Multi-region deployments, hybrid cloud architectures, secure private connectivity, and scalable network infrastructure
- **Scope** → Global services with regional and zonal components
- **Integration** → Works seamlessly with compute, storage, databases, and security services across GCP

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Networking Components
| Component | Purpose | Scope | Required |
|-----------|---------|-------|----------|
| VPC | Isolated network environment | Global | Yes |
| Subnets | Regional IP address ranges | Regional | Yes |
| Firewall Rules | Network security policies | Global/Regional | Yes |
| Routes | Traffic routing rules | Global | Auto-created |

### gcloud Commands
```bash
# List all networking resources
gcloud compute networks list
gcloud compute networks subnets list
gcloud compute firewall-rules list
gcloud compute routes list

# Create basic networking setup
gcloud compute networks create production-network --subnet-mode=custom
gcloud compute networks subnets create production-subnet \
    --network=production-network \
    --range=10.0.0.0/24 \
    --region=us-central1

# Check networking connectivity
gcloud compute networks get-effective-firewalls INSTANCE_NAME \
    --zone=us-central1-a
gcloud compute networks subnets get-iam-policy production-subnet \
    --region=us-central1

# Common networking operations
gcloud compute ssh INSTANCE_NAME --zone=us-central1-a
gcloud compute scp FILE_PATH INSTANCE_NAME:~/ --zone=us-central1-a
```
